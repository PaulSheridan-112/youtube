**YouTube - Embedded Video Project**

This project is part of The Odin Project's curriculum.

The aim of this project was to create a YouTube video player page and embed a
YouTube video.

To create the page, I split in up into different sections using <div>s.(I
gave each <div> a solid border until I was happy with there layout. The
borders were then removed)

As the aim of this project was only to learn how to embed a video, I chose
to fill in these <div>s with cropped images to create the correct YouTube
layout. This allowed me to complete the project in 1 hour.

I used Adobe Photoshop to crop the images.
